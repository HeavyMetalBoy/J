<p>Is RTX 2060 future proof?For someone who wants to game 1080p and doesn't want to spend a lot on a new GPU, the RTX 2060 is your best option right now. It supports ray tracing and DLSS and is also future proof for Full HD gaming. It takes advantage of Nvidia's new Turing tech and costs only Rs 31,000.</p>

<p>Most users will only need about 8 GB of RAM, but if you want to use several apps at once, you might need 16 GB or more. If you don't have enough RAM, your computer will run slowly and apps will lag. Although having enough RAM is important, adding more won't always give you a substantial improvement.</p>

<p>In 128GB you can run multiple High end Games plus some heavy softwares . Buy 128GB only if you want to run heavy Software and heavy games simultaneously. ... Further the cost of 128 GB stick is higher than core i5 processor. Go for Better GPU with more than decent amount of RAM.
</p>

<p>And, the answer to that is: in some scenarios and depending on how much RAM you have, yes, adding more RAM could increase your FPS. ... On the flip side, if you have a low amount of memory (say, 2GB-4GB), adding more RAM will increase your FPS in games that utilize more RAM than you previously had.</p>

<p>MBR meaning:A master boot record is a special type of boot sector at the very beginning of partitioned computer mass storage devices like fixed disks or removable drives intended for use with IBM PC-compatible systems and beyond. The concept of MBRs was publicly introduced in 1983 with PC DOS 2.0</p>

<p>GPT: GUID Partition Table (GPT) disks use Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). One advantage of GPT disks is that you can have more than four partitions on each disk. GPT is also required for disks larger than two terabytes (TB)</p>

<p>Yes and no. While is very possible for a gpu to catch a virus makes no sense. Most viruses want to gather user information like bank accounts etc. So a gpu virus wouldn't help unless the GPU is the back door that's unsecure to hack your computer.

  <p>TOSHIBA MK Hard drives:
Toshiba Storage Device Division’s MKxx65GSX range of 2.5-inch hard disk drives provides optimum mobility, unparalleled performance and increased storage space for the digital user constantly on the go.

Compared to similar 3.5-inch drives, the power consumption and heat dissipation are reduced by over 80%. These drives incorporate the latest Serial ATA technology and support a 3.0 Gbit/s interface data transfer rate.

All drives within the MKxx65GSXF family are with a Free Fall Sensor technology. This technology uses an embedded motion sensor to detect if the hard disk drive is in free fall. In such cases, the HDD immediately moves the read/write heads away from the spinning platter to prevent them damaging any data upon impact.</p>

<p>TOSHIBA MQ Hard Drives:Toshiba Storage Device Division offers a line of 5,400 RPM 2.5-inch HDDs in a new slim design optimized for industry-leading storage applications. The latest HDD series, MQ01ABDxxx, provides a wide capacity range from 250 GB to 1TB in a 9.5-millimeter-high design with only maximum 2 platters.

The advanced MQ01ABDxxx targets markets such as portable multimedia and gaming notebooks, mobile workstations and other capacity-hungry applications like external HDDs. In addition, the drives also feature very good power efficiency value of 0.00055 for the 1TB model. Due to the “Silent-Seek” technology featured in these drives, the HDDs are extremely quiet: Ultra-silent single-platter drives boast acoustic specifications of 19dBA (seek) and 17dBA (idle) making them almost indistinguishable to the human hear.

With its compact size and best-in class specifications, the SATA MQ01ABDxxx series is the perfect choice for use in devices where a combination of sleek form factor and high capacity capabilities are essential.

As with all Toshiba HDDs, the complete series is halogen-free and RoHS compatible, therefore, exceptionally nature friendly.</p>
